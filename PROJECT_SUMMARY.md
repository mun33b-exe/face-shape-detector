## 🚀 How to Use Your System

### 1. Basic Usage (Camera Mode)
```bash
python main.py --mode camera
```
**Controls:**
- `s` - Analyze face shape
- `1-3` - Apply hairstyle filters
- `4-6` - Apply beard filters
- `r` - Reset view
- `q` - Quit

### 2. Image Mode
```bash
python main.py --mode image --image your_photo.jpg
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
python test_basic.py
```

## 🧠 Understanding the AI Components

### Face Shape Classification Algorithm
The system uses facial measurement ratios:

```python
# Key measurements
face_ratio = face_length / face_width
jaw_to_forehead_ratio = jaw_width / forehead_width

# Classification logic
if face_ratio < 1.2:
    if jaw_to_forehead_ratio > 0.8:
        return 'round'
    else:
        return 'square'
elif face_ratio > 1.5:
    if jaw_to_forehead_ratio < 0.7:
        return 'heart'
    else:
        return 'oblong'
else:
    return 'oval'
```

### Style Recommendation Database
Each face shape has optimized style recommendations:
- **Oval**: Most versatile, suits most styles
- **Round**: Needs height and angles
- **Square**: Requires softening
- **Heart**: Balance wide forehead
- **Oblong**: Add width, reduce length
